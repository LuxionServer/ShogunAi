## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Android emulators across projects
The Android emulators view SHALL list the emulator of every worktree of the projects that declare the emulator provider, with its project, worktree, serial and state, and Start when stopped or not acquired, or Stop otherwise. A worktree emulator that isn't running SHALL show the AVD it will start instead of a serial, and one not acquired SHALL say so. It SHALL also list running emulators that no worktree owns, with a Stop action. Listing SHALL NOT reserve ports or start anything.

#### Scenario: Unowned emulator
- **WHEN** an emulator started from Android Studio is running and no worktree has its port reserved
- **THEN** it is listed as not owned by a worktree, with a Stop action

#### Scenario: Start from the machine view
- **WHEN** the user activates Start on a stopped worktree emulator in this view
- **THEN** the emulator starts as it would from the worktree's detail, and the state is shown in both places

#### Scenario: Stopped worktree emulator
- **WHEN** a worktree's emulator isn't running and the project uses the AVD `Pixel_8_API_35`
- **THEN** its row shows `Pixel_8_API_35` instead of "—", or "Automatic" when no AVD is set

#### Scenario: Not acquired
- **WHEN** a worktree never started its emulator
- **THEN** its row says it isn't acquired and offers Start, and no port is reserved for it

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Pool usage in the machine views
The Android emulators, iOS simulators and Gradle daemons views SHALL show their pool's usage against its effective limit and the active profile, with a link to Preferences' "Resources" section, and the sidebar summary SHALL include the usage against the limit. When a resource was released or stopped to make room or to stay within the limit, the view SHALL say which one and why until the user dismisses it.

#### Scenario: Usage shown
- **WHEN** the emulator limit is 2 and one worktree holds an emulator
- **THEN** the Android emulators view says 1 of 2 in use with the profile's name

#### Scenario: Release reported
- **WHEN** starting `TASK-2`'s emulator released `TASK-1`'s idle emulator
- **THEN** the Android emulators view says `TASK-1`'s emulator was released to make room for `TASK-2`

#### Scenario: Over the limit
- **WHEN** the Gradle limit is 2 and three busy daemons run
- **THEN** the Gradle daemons view shows 3 of 2 in use, marked as over the limit
