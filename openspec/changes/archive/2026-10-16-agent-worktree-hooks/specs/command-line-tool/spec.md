# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Create worktrees for Claude Code's WorktreeCreate hook
`shogun hook worktree-create` SHALL read the hook's JSON from standard input and create a provisioned worktree named after its `name` field, on a `feature/<name>` branch, in the repository containing its `cwd` field. It SHALL print the absolute worktree path as the last line of standard output, with any other message on standard error, and exit non-zero on failure.

#### Scenario: Repository with a project
- **WHEN** Claude Code runs the hook with `{"name": "TASK-123", "cwd": "~/projects/main-repo", …}` and the repository has a ShogunAi project
- **THEN** a worktree on `feature/TASK-123` is created in the project's worktrees folder, provisioned from `.shogunai.json`, `.worktreeinclude` and the project's local files, and its path is printed

#### Scenario: Repository without a project
- **WHEN** the repository has no ShogunAi project
- **THEN** the worktree is created in `<repository>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`, provisioned from the repository's files, and its path is printed

#### Scenario: Resuming an existing worktree
- **WHEN** the worktree for `name` already exists as a worktree of the repository
- **THEN** its path is printed and the command succeeds without creating or provisioning anything

#### Scenario: Invalid input
- **WHEN** standard input isn't JSON or lacks `name`
- **THEN** the command prints an error on standard error and exits with code 2, so Claude Code fails the creation

#### Scenario: Creation fails
- **WHEN** creating the worktree fails, e.g. because `.shogunai.json` is unreadable
- **THEN** the error is printed on standard error, nothing is printed on standard output and the command exits with code 1

### Requirement: Remove worktrees for Claude Code's WorktreeRemove hook
`shogun hook worktree-remove` SHALL read the hook's JSON from standard input and remove the linked worktree at its `worktree_path` field even if it has changes, as Claude Code's own fallback does, then delete the worktree's branch only if Git considers it merged, keeping it otherwise.

#### Scenario: Merged branch
- **WHEN** the hook runs for a worktree whose branch is merged
- **THEN** the worktree and its branch are removed and the command exits with code 0

#### Scenario: Branch with unmerged work
- **WHEN** the worktree's branch has commits that aren't merged
- **THEN** the worktree is removed, the branch is kept, a note saying so goes to standard error, and the command exits with code 0

#### Scenario: Not a worktree of the repository
- **WHEN** `worktree_path` is the main worktree or not a linked worktree
- **THEN** nothing is removed and the command exits with code 1
